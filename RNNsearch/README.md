Paper: Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate

Comment: I can't get expected performance in a Chinese-English translation task. But I think the 
implementation is right. At least, I can't find the mistakes. And a possible reason for the unexpected
performance is that GRUs are sensitive to parameter settings and such things.
